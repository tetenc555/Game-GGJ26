## About the game:
(This game is in brazilian portuguese so we could achieve the *"Stay Local"* diversifier) - pipipi popopo

## Diversifiers we achieved:
- Crossplatform play -> We used Godot!
- Stay local -> All of our ambietation and voice lines are informal, revolving around the drama that takes place in Xique Xique - Bahia
- Diverse -> We have 3 diversifies, including this one!
