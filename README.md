## About the game:
(This game is in brazilian portuguese so we could achieve the *"Stay Local"* diversifier) - This game is about a sapphic relationship and it's conflicts, as we move through our surroundings (and time), changing towards a better, healthier relationship in the future.  

## Diversifiers we achieved:
- Crossplatform play -> We used Godot!
- Stay local -> All of our ambientation and voice lines are informal, revolving around the drama that takes place in Xique Xique - Bahia
- Diverse -> We have 3 diversifies, including this one!
